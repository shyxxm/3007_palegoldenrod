# Introduction

Education and corruption represent critical dimensions in understanding the socioeconomic fabric of nations worldwide. A growing body of research has identified a robust correlation between levels of educational attainment and perceptions of corruption across countries. This relationship suggests that societies with higher average years of schooling tend to exhibit lower levels of corruption, as measured by indices such as Transparency International's Corruption Perception Index. Moreover, studies such as those by Glaeser and Saks (2006) [^glaeser] underscore the potential causal link between education and reduced corruption, illustrating how historical educational legacies can influence contemporary governance outcomes. This introduction sets the stage for exploring the nuanced interplay between education and corruption, emphasizing the multifaceted factors that contribute to these complex societal dynamics.

<!-- Given persistent skepticism in some communities about the efficacy of vaccines, it is important to communicate the impact of vaccination on public health. In this project, we built on a visualization of the measles incidence in the USA published by the Wall Street Journal[^debold_battling_2015] (@fig-wsj-on-poster). This visualization has garnered praise as "One of the more compelling data visualizations produced in recent years"[^lee_reproducing_2017]. However, we contend that, despite its effectiveness in summarizing data, several aspects of the plot can be improved. -->

# Strengths

*   Visual representation: The scatter plot effectively visualizes the relationship between learning-adjusted years of schooling and the Corruption Perception Index across various countries and regions.

*   Color coding: The use of different colors for different regions or continents makes it easier to identify and distinguish countries belonging to the same geographical area.

*   Clear labeling: The countries and regions are labeled directly on the plot, allowing for easy identification and reference.

*   Bubble size: The size of the bubbles (circles) represents the population of each country, providing an additional dimension of information.


# Suggested Improvements

<!-- 1.  *Add a plot title and a source note* so that the figure can be understood in -->
<!--     isolation (e.g., when shared on social media). -->
<!-- 1.  *Identify missing data clearly.*  Rendering unknown incidence fully -->
<!--     transparent will distinguish it from zero incidence, -->
<!-- 1.  *Include labels for every state.* To avoid overplotting, use two-letter -->
<!--     abbreviations instead of full state names and stagger the labels along the -->
<!--     y-axis. -->
<!-- 1.  *Add a title to the color legend.* -->
1.  *The inclusion of smoothing lines (trend lines).* It helps to visualize the general trends and relationships between the schooling index and the Corruption Perception Index within each global region.

1.  *Use a discrete color palette.* Continuous palettes can make it
    challenging for humans to detect patterns below just noticeable color
    differences.
1.  *Add a legend for population size* providing context about the scale of each country’s data.
1.  *Divide into more sections* provides a clearer comparison of regions with different socio-economic backgrounds.

1.  *Removing some of the lesser-known or less-popular countries* simplifies the visualization, reducing clutter and focusing attention on the more significant data points that are likely to be more familiar and relevant to the audience.

# Implementation


## Data

*   The data compares learning-adjusted years of schooling and the Corruption Perception Index for 2020 [^corruption-perception-index]. Learning-adjusted years of schooling integrate both the quantity and quality of education, acknowledging that similar duration of schooling can lead to different learning outcomes. The Corruption Perception Index from Transparency International measures perceived corruption, with lower values indicating higher perceived corruption.
*   We used data from the top 50 most popular countries [^top100].
*   We edited the schooling index and corruption index to 0-100 to spread out the distribution of the geom points..

## Software

We used the Quarto publication framework and the R programming language, along with the following third-party packages:

*   *readxl* for data import
*   *tidyverse* for data transformation, including *ggplot2* for visualization,*dplyr* for data manipulation tasks
    based on the grammar of graphics
*   *ggreal* extension for ggplot2 that helps in preventing overlapping text labels in plots.
*   *shadowtext* extension for ggplot2 that helps in adding shadow effects to text labels in plots.
*   *countrycode* converting country names and codes into various coding schemes.
*   *dbscan* for clustering data based on density.
*   *FNN* for performing KNN classificatio.

# Further Suggestions for Interactivity

Because our visualization was intended for a poster, we did not implement any interactive features, including the infotip. However, if the data are visualized in an HTML document, interactive features can be achieved using the R packages such as *plotly*. In that case we recommend customizing the hover information to provide detailed insights when users interact with the data points. This can be done by setting the tooltip parameter in ggplotly().



<!-- In that case, we recommend that the tile does not change its fill color. In contrast, the original visualization changes the fill color of the activated tile to light blue (see @fig-infotip_color_change), which can be misinterpreted as a change in incidence. Instead, we suggest highlighting the activated tile by thickening its border. -->


# Conclusion

<!-- We successfully implemented all suggested improvements for the non-interactive visualization. By labeling every state and choosing a colorblind-friendly palette, the revised plot is more accessible. The logarithmic color scale makes the decrease in incidence after the introduction of the vaccine less striking but enables readers to detect patterns in the low-incidence range more easily. -->

We successfully implemented all suggested improvements for the non-interactive visualization. By differentiating global regions with distinct colors and representing population sizes with bubble sizes, the plot effectively highlights the relationship between average years of schooling and the Corruption Perception Index across various countries. The choice of a colorblind-friendly palette ensures accessibility for a broader audience. The visual distinction between the Global North and Global South, along with the clear labeling of key countries, allows for easy interpretation of the data.
